    Message log system:
    create empty text array
    new function(Message){
        slice in a new text box at the front
        show the message
    }
    
    Put the background in.

    Maybe the character collector should be in here, fed by the select screen.

    Set up a message log system.

    set up communication with Flask.

    Put in our placeholder graphics.
    This should have its own preloader because ventually I should be feeding in commands on what graphics to load.

    Set up the fight.

    Figure out how to get the animations to trigger from socket commands.
